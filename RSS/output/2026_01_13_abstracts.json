    "abstract": "Hybrid water electrolysis provides an energy‐efficient route for hydrogen production by replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with oxidation of small organic or biomass‐derived substrates, lowering cell voltages and enabling co‐production of value‐added chemicals. However, competition with OER, transient intermediates, and dynamic catalyst transformations complicates mechanistic understanding. Conventional ex situ techniques cannot capture these short‐lived processes, whereas in situ and operando characterization techniques provide real‐time insights into reaction pathways, active phases, and degradation mechanisms. This review highlights recent advances in applying these techniques to uncover catalyst dynamics in hybrid electrolysis. How such mechanistic insights are guiding the rational design of catalysts toward improved efficiency, selectivity, and durability is emphasized. Finally, opportunities for developing next‐generation electrolyzers powered by renewable energy for sustainable hydrogen and chemical production are discussed."

    "abstract": "Potassium‐ion batteries (KIBs) require cathodes that combine structural robustness with fast K + transport and scalable manufacturing. Here, P2‐type KMO is developed using fast and efficient microwave heating process with controlled crystallite sizes (≈30–60 nm) and high crystallinity for Anode‐Free K‐ion batteries. In situ X‐ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman track reversible ‘breathing’ of the layered framework‐00l reflections shift smoothly to lower 2 θ on charge (c ≈ 12.6 → 12.8 Å) and return on discharge, with no persistent new phases‐evidence for mainly solid‐solution K + (de)intercalation. In K‐ion half‐cells, the cathode delivers 91.3 mAh g −1 with good rate capability; galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) (10 −11 –10 −9 cm 2 s −1 ) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirm favorable K + kinetics. Importantly, the material is further evaluated in an anode‐free K‐ion battery using carbon cloth as the current collector, achieving 83.5 mAh g −1 initially and 73.6% retention after 50 cycles with >99% Coulombic efficiency. The modest performance gap relative to half‐cells is attributed to limited K inventory and interfacial losses, indicating clear avenues for optimization. Microwave synthesis thus offers an efficient route to KMO compatible with both conventional and anode‐free operation."

    "abstract": "Understanding the physical and chemical properties of nanolayers is crucial for developing new and advanced nanomaterials. Irradiation with low‐energy, highly charged ions allows the modification of materials, creating novel surface structure features. The nanolayers can be characterized using surface‐sensitive techniques such as X‐ray reflectometry or grazing incidence X‐ray fluorescence (GIXRF). GIXRF is a non‐destructive spectroscopy method for analyzing elemental depth distributions in thin layer structures. The aim of this work was to analyze titanium (Ti) and titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanolayers deposited on Si substrate, unmodified and irradiated with low‐energy (100 of keV) highly charged Xe q+ ( q = 25, 30, 35), and to determine the influence of this process on the morphology of irradiated surfaces. The nanolayers were irradiated at the Kielce EBIS facility. The GIXRF measurements were performed at Elettra Synchrotron XRF beamline. The results obtained from the GIXRF method show that the intensity changes of analyzed fluorescence lines depend on the thickness of nanolayers and the ion charge states."

    "abstract": "Water electrolysis is pivotal for converting renewable energy into clean hydrogen fuel, addressing global energy demand sustainably. However, the development of highly efficient and cost‐effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant challenge, particularly at the industrial scale. This report explores a newly discovered pathway, the oxide path mechanism (OPM) for OER—mechanism involving the oxide formation and evolution during the reaction, emphasizing its potential to overcome existing limitations. OPM enables direct O─O coupling without oxygen vacancies, offering superior stability. We detail both classical and innovative in‐situ characterization techniques that are central to unraveling the OER mechanism. The advanced in‐situ electrochemical techniques, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Mössbauer spectroscopy, coupled with in‐situ structural analyses, provide crucial insights into the catalyst surface, the electrode‐electrolyte interface and the kinetics of OER. This review provides a systematic analysis integrating classical electrochemical methods with advanced in‐situ/operando techniques, specifically focusing on understanding OPM. While numerous studies have examined individual characterization methods, this study systematically integrates traditional electrochemical approaches with in‐situ and operando techniques, offering critical insights into their complementary roles in elucidating reaction pathways. The integration of these methodologies provides unprecedented understanding of catalyst behavior under operational conditions, guiding the rational design of next‐generation OER catalysts. Furthermore, we discuss essential standardized test toolkits and protocols, such as those for rotating disk electrode and membrane electrode assembly, which are vital for ensuring reproducibility and scalability in OER catalyst research."
