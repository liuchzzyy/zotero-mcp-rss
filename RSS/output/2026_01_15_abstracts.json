    "abstract": "Aqueous manganese batteries are attractive owing to the deeper Mn/Mn 2 ⁺ redox potential (–1.19 V vs SHE) compared with Zn, yet their development has been hindered by sluggish Mn 2 ⁺ diffusion and parasitic interfacial reactions. Here, the concept of asymmetric‐ion transport is introduced, where Mn 2 ⁺ and protons occupy distinct diffusion channels and act synergistically rather than competitively. Using Co(VO 3 ) 2 ·2H 2 O as a model host, direct structural evidence is provided from Fourier electron density maps and ICP‐OES that 0.50 mol of Mn 2 ⁺ is reversibly accommodated alongside 0.14 mol of H⁺. Migration‐barrier calculations further reveal orthogonal pathways with balanced activation energies (0.602 eV for Mn 2 ⁺, 0.334 eV for H⁺), rationalizing the coexistence of Mn‐dominant storage and proton‐assisted kinetics. This dual‐ion mechanism enables high reversibility, robust cycling stability, and quasi–zero‐strain behavior. When paired with a Mn metal anode, the full cell delivers 1.3 V, substantially 0.4 V higher than Zn analogues, while highlighting the necessity of Mn anode interface stabilization. Beyond a new cathode material, this study establishes asymmetric‐ion transport as a generalizable paradigm for reconciling multivalent‐ion storage with fast kinetics in high‐voltage aqueous batteries."

Such rational design simultaneously addresses the key issues of volume expansion and poor conductivity in Mn2O3, enabling excellent rate capability and stable cycling."
